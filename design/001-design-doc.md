# 001 - Design Documents

## What?

In order to make communication easier and keep track of the decisions we made, I propose to introduce *design documents* in which we document our choices.
This document itself is the first design document.

## Why?

While iterating on the Tyche project, we have to make a lot of design decisions.
Those decisions needs to be communicated to the whole team, as they may impact multiple aspect of the projects.
Sometimes, some decisions are not trivial and might need proper discussion, and once a path is decided it is good to keep a trace of why this decision was made.

## How?

I propose that we document our most important decisions, as well as decisions implying trade-off or design choice when the design space is not obvious.
This process should not take too much time, ideally the design documents are kept short and should be written in ~10 minutes at most.

To keep the structure simple and understandable, I propose a "what", "why", "how" format, like for this document:
- **what**: What is the document about/what should we change?
- **why**: Why doing thing this way? Are there other options?
- **how**: How will the new solution work? What are the changes?

In addition, I propose to give the documents names starting with a unique ID, e.g. `001` for this document, to keep them sorted easily.
